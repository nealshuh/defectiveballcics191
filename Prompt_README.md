# Defective Ball Problem

There are 10 boxes, each with 10 balls. In 9 of these boxes, all the balls are 10 gm. In one of these boxes, the balls weigh 9 gm. This box holds the "defective balls". You have access to a electronic weighing machine, that reports the weight. Given only one chance to use the electronic weighing machine, how do you figure out which box holds the defective balls without relying on chance? (One chance means that you will only be able to use the weight of one group of objects you put on the weigh scale. For example, say that you choose to weigh the combined weight of 1 ball from each box by putting them all on the machine once. That weight is the only information you could get from the electronic weighing machine for the rest of the puzzle.)
