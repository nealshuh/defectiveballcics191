# Defective Ball Problem

There are 10 boxes, each with 10 balls. In 9 of these boxes, all the balls are 10 gm. In one of these boxes, the balls weigh 9 gm. This box holds the "defective balls". You have access to a electronic weighing machine, that reports the weight. Given only one chance to use the electronic weighing machine, how do you figure out which box holds the defective balls without relying on chance?
